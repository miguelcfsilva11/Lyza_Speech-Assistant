# Lyza - Speech Assistant
<img src="image/lyza-full-logo.png" width="560" height="248">

Lyza is my own personal assistant that helps me with my day-to-day life. It makes use of Google's Text-To-Speech API to scrape the web, find the definition of many terms on Wikipedia, check what is trending on Twitter, and open YouTube on its own. I hope that by the time this project comes to an end it will be capable of much more.
As for now, I am focused on developing the user's interface, so they can communicate with Lyza.
